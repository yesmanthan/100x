//FIRST WE LEARN ABOUT VARIABLES
//THERE ARE  3 TYPES OF VARIABLES VAR,LET & COST
//LET= WE JUST GAVE THE VALUE TO LWT OS JUST ASSUME IT (LIKELY TO ME MORE USED  THAN VAR)
//CONST = IN CONSTANT IF EW CHANGE THE VALUE IT WILL THROW THE ERROR
//VAR =IT  JUST STANDS FOR VARIABLE LIKE  LER  BUT LET HAS MORE TEST CASES THAN VAR 
 /// LETS EXPERIMENT IT 
 
 let a=100;
 console.log(a);
 let b=200;
 b=250;
console.log(b);

var c=300;
console.log(c);
var d=400;
d=450;
console.log(d);

const e=500;
console.log(e);
const f=600;
//f=650;//changing the value the error will like be TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
console.log(f);
